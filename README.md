# Arduino  based hand gestures control of computer using python programming

Arduino based hand gesture control of the computer using python programming is Artifical intelligence based system

## Introduction

* Human Machine Interface or HMI is a system comprising of hardware and software that
helps in communication and exchange of information between the user (human operator) and
the machine (laptops/computer).

* We normally use LED Indicators, Switches, Touch Screens and LCD Displays as a part of
HMI devices. Another way to communicate with machines like Robots or Computers is with
the help of Hand Gestures.

* Instead of using a keyboard, mouse or joystick, we can use our hand gestures to control
certain functions of a computer like play/pause a video, move left/right in a photo slide show
and scroll up/down in a web page and many more.

* In this project, we have implemented a simple Arduino based hand gesture control where we
can control few functions of ourr web browser like scrolling up and down in web pages,
scrolling up and down in Microsoft word, giving presentation in the Microsoft PowerPoint,
play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player), play or pause a
audio and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player), obtaining access to gaming in the
personal computer, moving left or right in a photo slide show. These desired functions can be
achieved with the help of hand gestures.
